Hello sir,
      As per the discussion we expect the following module in python
1) We have raw data in .csv format so we have to store the data in mysql and then perform the exploratory data analysis.(data cleaning)
2)  Train the dataset with 80:20(train and test data)
3) Apply the machine learning model to predict the future trends.
